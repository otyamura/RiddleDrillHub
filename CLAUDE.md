## Repository Status

This repository appears to be newly initialized with only git configuration and Claude Code settings. There are no source files, package.json, or documentation present yet.

## Current Structure

- `.git/` - Git repository configuration
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions (currently allows `Bash(ls:*)`)

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development setup will depend on what type of project is being created. Common next steps might include:

- Initialize a specific project type (Node.js, Python, etc.)
- Add package configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Set up build and test scripts
- Create initial project structure

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project structure and requirements become clearer.
